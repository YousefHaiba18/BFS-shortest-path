# BFS-shortest-path


This program visualizes how the Breadth First Search algorithm works in order to obtain the shortest path between 2 points on a graph.

I used python and imported the curses module to visualize the graph, note that due to compatibilty issues if you are using windows I would recommend using an online compiler like replit.
